Git Installation and Uploading Model Training Code to GitHub

Step 1: Install Git
For Windows:
Download Git from the official Git website: Git for Windows.
Run the installer and follow the instructions (you can leave most options at their defaults).
For macOS:
Install Git using Homebrew: brew install git.

For Linux (Debian-based systems like Ubuntu):
Update your package list and install Git: sudo apt update followed by sudo apt install git.

Verify the installation by running: git --version.

Step 2: Set Up Git in VS Code
Open VS Code.
Go to View -> Command Palette, type Git: Clone if you're cloning an existing repository.
If starting from scratch, initialize a local Git repository by running git init in the terminal.
Step 3: Set Up a GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
Name the repository and click Create repository.
Step 4: Push Code to GitHub
In VS Code, navigate to the folder containing your model training code.

Add your files to Git: git add ..

Commit your changes: git commit -m "Initial commit for model training code".

Link your local repository to the GitHub repository: git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git.

Push your changes to GitHub: git push -u origin master.

Step 5: Verify Your Code on GitHub
Visit your GitHub repository to confirm that your model training code has been successfully uploaded.
